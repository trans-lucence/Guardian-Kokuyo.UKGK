Welcome to the home of Kokuyo Kinoya, Guardian of the Shrine of Aces of Kosanu! Make yourself at home.

INFO AND NOTES:
- Kokuyo's location changes depending on the day of the week! On weekends, many dialogues and a few dictionary entries can change. Experiment, and open the ghost on different days to find out different secrets!

- In the rare event of a random dialogue having the ability to unlock content, the 'balloon' (text box) will freeze until you click it. This is to prevent missing important dialogue while you are away. This can be turned off in the settings menu.

- A considerable amount of the written content is in the 'dictionary' -- press 'D' to open it, or double-click Wanderer and select "Tell me about..." to explore the lore of their world!

- Hotkeys make everything easier! There is a list of useful Hotkeys in the double-click menu.

- The default shell size (size of the character) is, as you can see, pretty big; this ghost was originally meant to be put onto a second monitor. You can change their size by right-clicking on Wanderer, then going to "Shell scaling > x%." I recommend ~50% shell scaling if you are using the Ghost on your primary monitor.

MISC. NOTES:
All writing, worldbuilding and art is done by myself alone. Code, however, has been heavily referenced and studied from the helpful folks in the Ukagaka Dream Team community.
Moreover, if any art or writing of mine is plagiarized or stolen from this project (or me in general), I'll kick your ass.
Kokuyo goes by they/them. If you talk about them, please refer to them with these pronouns. They are gender-ambiguous by design.
