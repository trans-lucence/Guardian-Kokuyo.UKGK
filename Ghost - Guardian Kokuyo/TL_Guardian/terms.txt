*PLEASE READ THIS, AS IT HAS IMPORTANT WARNINGS AND INFORMATION!*

**This Ghost is ONLY for those who are 16+. Please respect this, as I am uncomfortable with those younger than this being exposed to certain elements of this piece of fiction. If you're under the age of 16, come back later! There are plenty of great, more teen-friendly ghosts to play with.**

You can pull this up to reread it by pressing F2 after clicking on/interacting with the ghost. It is also in the right-click menu by going to "Information > Terms of this ghost."

CONTENT WARNINGS:
- Unreality (Kokuyo treats the User as if the User is within their fictional world)

*Mentions* of the following:
- Alcohol, drugs / Substance abuse
- Written (NON-EXPLICIT) sexual content and themes
- Homocide and Genocide
- Suicide, and other deliberate harm of oneself
- Written body horror, and other uncomfortable written imagery.

Mentions of the above are rare, but they are *not* toggleable or otherwise avoidable as of right now, as it would trim down the lore and make certain things very confusing. Most of these are mentioned by Kokuyo in reference to others or as part of a myth/piece of history, not partaking themselves (though there are small, rare exceptions).

All sexual content is strictly NON-EXPLICIT and written in, to put it bluntly, the least arousing way possible. No images within/of the ghost are sexual or explicit, and none of the sexual content is directed to the User. (An example would be the the Kokuyo simply states that another character is a prostitute, not much more detail than that.)

All people, locations, events and other such information is purely fictional. Myths, history, cultures, locations, etc. may be inspired by real-world equivalents.
