	"Ah! The First Aces... \s[1]as you can most likely extrapolate from the title, these were the, ehm, first-ever Ace Cards. \s[0]An Ace, as you may already know, is a Card with an entirely different type of flow than ordinary folks like you and I. The Firsts, however, were a whole other story... they appeared during a time of great unrest, starting one thousand and thirty-seven years ago, in an event we now call The Emergence. \n\s[1]First to emerge was Viro, First Ace of Spades; a tall man with thickly curled horns and salt-and-pepper hair, he appeared from the mist, walking out of a thick forest of Velanne covered in dirt and his own blood. He disappeared as quickly as he was found.\n A few months later, something similar happened in Lacerta -- \s[0]Lairu of Hearts was found unconscious in the middle of the desert, and brought to a small village near modern-day Chiluno. When they awoke, they spoke in tongues no one had ever heard of -- or heard since. \s[3]Though they seemed to have sustained injuries to vital organs, and no Parasite was seemingly present in their body to regulate their energyflow, they got off of the doctor's operation table and walked straight into a blustering sandstorm, not to be seen again for months.\n \s[0]Nore of Clubs walked out of the ocean covered in seafoam, marching straight through villages and towns until they arrived in the heart of Thiremor. There, they sat down, crossed their legs, closed their eyes, and sank into the earth, with no sign they'd ever been there at all. Witnesses wrote that the patch of earth they'd disappeared into later grew strange plants, ones that weren't normally native to Aidhmoore. "

	"\s[1]Of course, all of these happenings were seen as these scary, horrible omens -- which, in hindsight, makes a lot of sense...\n \s[0]Lairu was the first to reappear, not seeming to remember being found near-dead in the desert just a year prior -- they showcased immense magical talent, however, and became a sort of shepherd of the then-suffering suit of Hearts.\n Viro reappeared next, his memories of the bizarre event also faded. Attempting to enter society, he challenged the people of Paccevela to lighthearted duels and quickly earned the title of 'the Bloodied Gladiator' -- the, er, 'Bloodied' part being in reference to his omen-like appearance from the year before. The duels themselves were never to the death, only until someone \f[height,-2]-- or, well, only ever Viro's opponent --\f[height,default] tapped out. He later wrote that he never liked that title, but that 'as long as my people are happy, I am happy.' \s[1]How nice of him..!\n\n \s[0]Nore appeared right where they had sank into the earth a year before, keeping somewhat away from society. People who met them wrote that they had a deeply anxious soul. "

But she knew that this massacre, pointless and cruel, needed to be put to an end.\n \s[0]As the army of Hearts advanced north, closer to Alonai'a's place of emergence, the freshly formed Ace froze them in their tracks. A vortex of energy emerged, invisible to the naked eye -- titled by researchers later on as an \f[italic,1]'Imaginary Sinkhole'\f[italic,default]. The army dropped dead; hundreds of lives taken in an instant, their blood drained straight from their bodies and their energy alongside it.

	"\w9\s[1]This was an act done by Alonai'a not only to save her people from certain death, but also to bring balance to the land. See, she was the last Ace to awaken, and Lairu -- First Ace of Hearts -- had recently created a stark imbalance in the land itself; \s[0]they, using their own Imaginary Sinkhole, had sewn the seeds of the Black Desert.\n\w9\w8The Black Desert, with its extensive energy spikes, had been the thing to drive the Hearts out of their territory in the first place... the Kyone, opposite of the Desert in every way, put each Suit back into its sacred home.\s[0]"

Del Noccione is the Ace of Spades. He was born to Elina and Rollas Noccione, two \_a[OnWhatFlow]Jacks\_a who were very well-respected in \_a[OnScavva]Scavva\_a.

	"He managed to evade being found as the Ace of Spades until he was fourteen, before he got into a fight with some guard who was on the same squadron as his father... the man had insulted Elina.

All he had to comfort him was the pale warmth emanating from his neck\w9 -- \s[1]perhaps he still doesn't know quite what that was, but... the energetic hotspots, or \w2\f[italic,1]stigmata\f[italic,default]\w2 of an Ace are the greatest sources of their energy. \s[3]The warmth he felt emanating from the double-Diamond stigmata on his neck was\w3... likely the last of his energetic reserves, working overtime to keep him from dropping dead.\n He wrote that he would pass through towns, sleep in abandoned sheds or behind restaurants, surviving by sneaking into the kitchens of those closed restaurants at night to 'borrow' -- \s[1]as he puts it -- \s[3]their soon-to-expire foods. On occasion, he would hang around the windows of schools, listening in on the lessons to try to scrap together an education of some kind. Despite his knowledge of being an Ace, he barely knew anything about what that meant -- other than the fact that he should have magic, and somehow... didn't. Up to the last pages, he writes that he still has no idea what his powers are, how he is even an Ace... hence the abuse from the higher-ups at the Academy.\n "
	"He also writes that he... avoided the temples on purpose, though he knew they'd have to take him in, because... the last thing his mother had said to him before \f[italic,1]leaving him\f[italic,default] to \f[italic,1]rot\f[italic,default] was that...\w9\w9 he was the Ace of Diamonds.\n\n As I got to the journal titled 'ninth' -- \s[1]that's right, this was nine journals' worth, and he had only started them a few months before disappearing!.. The tone started to shift. \s[3]As opposed to that comparatively vague 'written to the Firsts and their Guardians' note, \s[1]the ninth journal consisted solely of a sort of 'letter' addressed to... \s[3]ehm, \w6\f[italic,1]me\f[italic,default]. \w8He writes that, as a child with very little knowledge of how the temples worked, he had assumed that I, or any of the shrine attendants, would be obligated to bring him to the Madame -- something he later learned was the opposite of true -- and so he avoided us. He then writes that he had come to regret it, that he had heard great things about me from Del -- \s[1]he always did know how to flatter me, that young man -- \s[0]and that, if he could change one thing... \w9the first thing that he would have done\s[3]\w9... would be to come to me, \w5tell me everything that had happened, and gone with whatever I decided was best. That... was the last 'chapter' in the final journal, before the pages run blank, the rest of the story following a paperless trail alongside his beloved. Every time I read it, it sends an ache to the pit of my heart, one that I had forgotten I could feel. I hope he knows, now, that I would never have done a single thing to cause him harm.\n\n ...\w9\s[1]Thank you. It was... \w9it was good to tell someone. You are... a good listener, %(oomf).\n \w9\s[3]..."

	"Ah! Ani'ana Prefecture, my homeland... of course I'll tell you about it! Let's see, where should we start?..\n Ani'ana Prefecture is a large group of many small islands on the north and west coasts of Kosanu. The Prefecture gets its name from the largest island of them, named simply Ani'ana... \s[1]this naming convention tends to confuse foreigners, so don't feel too bad if you're not following, ehehe.\s[0]\n "
	"This island is where Alonai'a emerged -- which is why their names sound somewhat similar... there are many small temples dedicated to her there, including the shrine I trained and took my ceremonial tests at, many years ago. Oh, ehm, fun fact! That shrine is actually older than any other on the continent; it was built before Alonai'a even emerged, constructed about 1,200 years ago, in hopes that a savior would come... \s[1]I suppose, one truly did! Anyways... the surrounding islands are much smaller, really only having two or three villages each to their name...\s[0]\n "
	"The western islands extend down, peppering themselves into Aidhish territory; Oltronnt, a large island sitting snugly between the territorial lines, derives its name from the Aidhish term 'shared space,' and is home to a half-and-half population of the two Suits. For tax reasons, however, the entire island is considered to be included in Ani'ana Prefecture... \s[1]oh, that was a tangent, wasn't it? Ehehe... right, back on track.\n\n "

	"The history of the region is vast, as the islands were basically the Diamond's only home for several thousand years. Until we figured out seafaring, we lived in the vast caves of Ani'ana, coming out at night to fish and play in the snow...\n" 
	"A few millennia into our civilization, we finally figured out boats. It's not as easy as you'd think; we didn't exactly work with wood very often, nor did we have a wealth of trees to experiment with in the first place!.. Anyway, some of us sailed to what is now \_a[OnShuioNui]Shui'o Nui\_a, and some of us stayed in Ani'ana. Our civilizations were growing wonderfully, enough to split into two groups!.. Those who travelled to Shui'o Nui incorporated a mail system, to keep communication between the two settlements quick and easy... \s[1]very efficient! \n\n"

	"\w9\w9...On a more modern note, the cuisine in Ani'ana is vastly different than that of Shui'o Nui.. As it is an island, we of course eat lots of fish... \s[1]well, alright. I admit, we eat lots of fish here in Shui'o Nui, but...\w9 but it's different! \s[3]Ehm...\n \s[0]Ani'ani cuisine focuses more on utilizing offshore crops, such as oceangrass. My favourite dish from the island is Saltscale Grassrolls... it's raw or smoked Saltscale, wrapped in oceangrass and frozen! Very good...\w9 er, where was I? Right! Ehm...\n\n "

	"It's smart to have knowledge of seafaring before you try to make your way out to the islands. The water gets very choppy on the north side, due in part to bordering the Kyone... I'd recommend getting a few sailing lessons before you visit."

The area directly bordering \_a[OnScavva]Scavva\_a, separated by the large Northern Quatangu Canal, has some spotty forests here and there, but... ehm, \s[1]lumber isn't exactly our main export, if you understand what I mean. \s[0]That's why it's so sparsely populated, as well... harder to find materials to build the houses, ehe.\n\n "

	"\s[3]\w9...After her untimely demise, we simply decided it was best to leave the Kyone alone. Travelling into it was -- \f[italic,1]is\f[italic,default] -- a death sentence. The bone-white snow of the Tundra, blown about by the silently rushing winds, is enough to harm you if you breathe it in. During the months of Moonfall, the time when the wind rushes south, we Diamonds close our windows and lock our doors so that the soundless gusts do not take us in our sleep.\n \s[1]Stepping foot there will bleach your hair the colour of the shining moonlight, and the blood of your fingers and lowpaws will slow, making them cold as ice for the rest of your life. \s[3]Then,\w9 if you are lucky,\w9\w5 you will die.\n\n "

It's the more rural side of the country -- much less hustle and bustle there than in \_a[OnVelanne]Velanne\_a. It's full of farmland, \s[1]as well as wineries, of course.

It's \f[italic,1]that\f[italic,default] crowded!.. \s[3]Hence why I don't visit unless I have to, \s[1]ehehe...\n\n \s[0]Syk is divided into three districts; the South District is the largest, serving as a shopping district. Malls, hotels and casinos are practically stacked on top of each-other... \s[1]oh, and a ton of movies are filmed here, so expect lots of celebrity sightings, too!..\n\n \s[0]The East District is the financial district, full of bustling office-workers... \s[1]and the occasional streetwalker, ha. I suppose it's not too surprising... those working in the financial district would need some 'relief,' too.\n\n \s[0]Last but certainly not least, the North District is the smallest of all, existing mostly as a residential area, but also a bustling red-light district.

I stay far away from it, since the idea of running into \_a[OnWhoMadame]her Majesty\_a or any other nobility makes me nauseous... but, the outer rings are great.\n\n Ah, I should explain... the city is built in 'rings.' Though, they are... not actually circular. They are moreso 'rows,' but I will quit with the pedantics... er, right. The innermost ring -- 'Iy Palacca' -- is the smallest, but most intricate -- this is where the Madame and her family live, and where they hold certain events. It is almost entirely consumed by the Palace itself... however, some 'smaller' mansions border the outskirts of the Palace Gardens.\n\n The Second ring is for Jacks and other rich folk, nothing too interesting there. I once tried to visit it -- I had just gotten away from one of the Madame's feasts, and was trying to find real food. Couldn't find anything worth the money -- you know how snooty folk are, they think they can fill up on a quarter of a reasonable portion... I continued my search until I suddenly got escorted out by the royal police for... er,\w9 well,\w9 the reason they gave was\w9\w6 simply because I am a Pip? And I heard one mention something about me being a Diamond, as well...\w9\w6 suffice to say, I don't visit it much anymore. I would avoid it, if I were you. The food is \f[italic,1]not\f[italic,default] worth the hassle, and their customs are... archaic, to say the least.\n\n Anyway... the Third and Fourth rings are where Iy starts to shine -- when someone says 'Iy,' they are almost definitely talking about these two outermost rings...\n In common Lacertan fashion, there are folks of many walks of life here; not as much of a mixed bag as \_a[OnSyk]Syk\_a, but there are more than a few 'clusters' of other Suits living here. A small section of the city is nicknamed 'Velannicci' -- Pacce for 'little Velanne' -- due to the high population of Spades. 'Clovertown' is a cute little area as well; it's themed entirely around Aidhish tradition, and boasts a large population of Clubs. We Diamonds are spread so thin that we don't have a cute little area for ourselves in Iy... but! I was at least able to find a few restaurants serving authentic Ani'ani cuisine -- something you'd be hard-pressed to find off the island, let alone outside of Kosanu! And let me tell you, it was simply divine...\w9\w4 oh, whoops! I've gotten off-track, haven't I?... Er, right...\n\n Actually... that about wraps it up for Iy, really. If you ever visit, be sure to visit a few Kosani restaurants! You can report back to me if they strike your fancy..."

Oh, right... I guess we generally have more eyes than the other Suits, too... \s[1]I always forget that! When I travel, I tend to wonder how everyone else sees, having only two or three... \s[0]ah, \s[3]I hope that isn't insensitive! \s[1]Ahem...\n We're generally more suited for colder environments, having hailed from a land of snow and ice. \s[0]Our Suit is represented, of course, by a four-pointed diamond shape, but we also tend to use the four-pointed star as a secondary symbol. \s[1]Much more artsy... ehehe. \s[0]The First Ace of Diamonds is \_a[OnWhoAlonaia]Alonai'a\_a -- we Diamonds hold the Firsts in much higher regard than the others tend to... \s[1]ehm, we have our reasons for doing so, but... that's irrelevant, for now.

Their First Ace is Viro, who many of its citizens don't care much for or know of... however, as you get close to the coast and further from the Facecards' iron grip, you may start to see more shrines and temples dedicated to Viro. \s[1]Gio, the Guardian of the Shrine of Paccevela, is the first of his lineage to truly spread the word that Viro was not as barbaric as the Facecards make him seem... and truly, what an accomplishment on his part! \s[0]I digress, however; I'm getting offtopic, rambling about my dear friend.

	"\n\n 'Flow' is the ability to harness the energy in your body, and use it to affect the world around you. It has a physical presence in your body, and can be seen by a special type of people, aptly named 'Seers...' more on them in a moment.\n\n Your 'rank' is a title given to you by a Seer at a certain age -- that age depends on which Quadrant you're in, how far away you are from the mainland, if your family is nobility... et cetera.\n A Seer will 'read' the flow of energy within your body, and assign you a number. Now, that specific number is secret -- only the government knows it -- but they will tell you whether you are a Pip or a Jack... or, well, there's Aces, too, but... \s[1]ehm, that's complicated. We will get to them another time. There's only four every hundred or so years, so they're not too important to explain right now...\n\n \s[0]Anyways!.. Pips are 'normal folk,' like you and I. We have very little flow, and many of us can barely use spells -- if at all. For us, the names 'rank' and 'flow' are somewhat interchangeable, and many won't get on your case if you accidentally say one when you meant the other.\n A Jack, on the other hand, is \f[height,-1]\w2almost\w2\f[height,default] any Card that has high flow. Freshly-read Jacks, even if they are the poorest of the poor, get sort of... forced into nobility. The civilian population is, in a way, artificially tampered with to keep the average flow low... \s[3]this is done to keep the physically stronger Cards in power, and anyone weak is left to fend for themselves. It is... a cruel system.\n\n \s[1]Right... um, Facecards are a Rank, \s[0]but being a Facecard is not really based on flow. Being a 'Facecard' simply means you are part of one of the four royal families. Due to having good genetics \f[height,-2]\w3\s[3]...as well as, up until recently, quite a bit of 'keeping it in the family,' in the case of Hearts' and Spades' royal families,\w2\s[0]\f[height,default] the Facecards \f[italic,1]do\f[italic,default] tend to have very high flow, but... \s[1]it's not required. It's simply a title. As much as they don't want to admit it, royals are simply people, just like us.\n\n \s[0]"

	"To make it short... Flow is innate, and Rank is governmental. \n\s[1]The way I see it, neither matter at all. We are all people, and we are all good at different things. The fire burning within you is bright, no matter the strength of the kindling. \n \s[0]...I hope my explanation suffices, %(oomf)."

It's just that we are, well... less powerful, less important. \s[1]I like it that way, really...\n \s[0]The first Guardians were each granted divinity by their respective First Ace. This divinity simply grants us the ability to control the energy of the temples we take care of, as well as any other shrines within that suit's 'jurisdiction,' so to speak. It can also grant you a longer lifespan, if you're lucky! Biologically speaking, it is a physical 'piece' of the First's flow, implanted within us and acting as a sort of 'key' for the shrines.

	"I will tell you about my favourite native Kosani animal, the Kikuminu! It is a fluffy little thing... they are native to the Ani'ana Prefecture of Kosanu, but are also a common pet throughout the landmass. They are quadrupedal, with huge ears on the tops of their heads, ha!\n Diamonds and Kikuminu share many attributes -- Kikuminu, too, have bushy tails and small paws. However, they only have two eyes -- poor little things. I wonder how they see!\n\n Kikuminu are colourblind -- though, I suppose that doesn't matter much, being native to an environment with primarily white and blue... ehehe!\n Their sense of smell is extremely acute, as well as their hearing -- another attribute we share.\n\n They are omnivores, but prefer a meaty diet... wild Kikuminu have very sharp teeth to hunt prey, while more domesticated lines have tended towards duller, slightly shorter teeth. There exist a few coat variations in both colour and length, but most are a pale white... as well as extremely fluffy, ehehe.\n\n They are semi-aquatic; in their natural state, they spend about 40% of their time in the water, hunting aquatic prey and... well, seemingly just swimming around for the hell of it.\n\n They're very cute... the lady who owns the fish market over in Okkai has a really friendly one, you should ask to pet it sometime!"
	
	"I'll tell you about a common livestock animal native to Kosanu: the Sunnai. You've probably seen them... my neighbors have a huge flock of them, you'd have to pass their pasture every time you come here from town. They're the big, fat wooly things that flop around...\w9\w9 yes, yes, the ones with the big curly horns! Those are domestic Sunnai, omnivorous semi-aquatic animals native to the Shui'o Nui and Ani'ana Prefectures of Kosanu.\n\n Thousands of years ago, our ancestors hunted wild Sunnai for their horns. These horns were made into the hilts of weapons, since they're curved to the perfect contour of the hand, very nice to hold... I happen to have a sword fashioned with a Sunnai horn as the hilt, haha.\n The Sunnai were also hunted for their fatty blubber, to make candles as well as to use as a base for soups.\n\n Wild Sunnai are very aggressive, which led to the death of many hunters at the time; eventually, however, some brave soul learned...\w9\w6 somehow...\w9\w6 that you can actually milk them!\w5 And on top of that, they learned that the milk was \f[italic,true]absolutely delicious\f[italic,false]. This made people start to realize, 'ah, maybe we should domesticate these animals,' something that was... easier said than done, to say the least.\n Starting somewhere around a thousand years ago, the Sunnai were finally able to be wrangled, and slowly became less aggressive as they warmed up to Cards. Today, some are raised for their milk, but others are raised to output as much blubber as possible -- if you ever see a pasture full of absolutely \f[italic,true]rotund\f[italic,false] Sunnai, they are most likely being bred specifically for their blubber, ha!\n The horns are harvested at death, and are now used to make tools and such...\n\n The wild Sunnai population has also recovered very well. You can find a great lot of them if you travel up to the coast of Shui'o Nui Prefecture in the Selyr... if you go at the very beginning of Moonfall, you may be able to witness the herds all gathering for their migration southeast to Quatangu Loch. Truly, an amazing sight... just don't let them spot you, ha! The wild ones are still a bit mean...\n\n If you ever get the chance to try blubber-base stew, you should! It is very tasty, and it goes great in a nice, crispy bread bowl... truly divine."
	
	"Ooh, I have a good one... I'll teach you about one of my favourite snacks, the Clarenchetti biscuit.\n \s[0]Back about three hundred years ago, in the Seventeenth Age, a famous Scavve confectioner was visiting the city of Iy, Lacerta. Iy is famous for its spicy foods, so the sweet-toothed confectioner was having a difficult time getting through each meal... his husband -- a Heart, for context -- laughed at him, telling him that he should stick to milder foods. The confectioner took this as a challenge, of course, and started thinking of ways he could prove his beloved wrong... \n He took some of the leftovers back to the inn they were staying at, and asked to use their kitchen -- they obliged, as his reputation preceded him. By mixing a sugary concoction with the spicy pepper paste from his previous meal, he created a sweet-and-spicy coulis -- er, that's a fancy word for 'fruit sauce' -- and sandwiched it neatly between two biscuits. A craze was born; people couldn't stop mixing sweet and spicy! Many new and interesting Scavve-Iyal fusion dishes were created during this time, such as sweet noodles -- which, yes, we Diamonds discovered hundreds of years before them... but the Iyal version tastes quite different, so I can't blame them for taking credit, ehehe! \n\n The snack is traditionally stamped with a mixed Heart and Spade symbol. This represents the confectioner and his husband's relationship, which sparked the ordeal... so cute!"

They can move around, and the tips can even bend to hold things..!\n They were more useful when we lived underground; in the rare event of the cave being too dark, our ancestors grasped small torches with their antennae, leaving their hands free to climb or carry things.\n\n As time has gone on, and as we exercised our little 'head hands' less, they have... evolved backwards, so to speak. Adapted their way out of being useful... now we mostly just put jewelry on them! Still, I think it's an interesting little feature.\n ...And, if you're around folks who aren't aware they can move, you can freak them out a bit by wiggling the antennae around. \s[1]Always a fun thing to do at parties, when it's in need of a bit of chaos... ehehe."

Thankfully, however, we have masks and special glasses we can wear if we plan on being outside for long periods of time... some are even quite stylish.\n Personally, I dislike them... not too comfortable, in my opinion.
